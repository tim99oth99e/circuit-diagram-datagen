# circuit-to-latex

Deep-learning model that predicts (CircuiTikz) LaTeX from images of electrical circuits.

## TODO:

- [ ] List all the tokens (by type) used for the first models.
- [ ] write a script to convert a LaTeX file to images.

## Steps to generate data (Windows)

- Install LaTeX
- Install [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html)
- Ensure that both _bin_ directories in the _Path_ environment variable. (You can verify it by typing `latex --version` and `gswin64c --version`)
